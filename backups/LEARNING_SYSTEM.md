# ðŸ“š DASI English: Learning System Design

This document details the core pedagogical framework of DASI English, centered around a **Data-Driven Vocabulary Stratification** and a **10-Stage Growth System**. Our goal is to guide users through a structured and intuitive learning path that mirrors the natural process of language acquisition.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Data-Driven Vocabulary Stratification

We move beyond simple vocabulary quantity. Our curriculum is built on **Word Frequency Lists**, ensuring that learners prioritize the most statistically relevant vocabulary at each stage. This Pareto-optimal approach (80/20 rule) maximizes communicative ability with the most efficient learning investment.

## 2. The 10-Stage Growth System

Each level is a distinct evolutionary stage of language ability. The system is designed to make the user's growth tangible and rewarding.

| Level | Title | Cumulative Vocab | Core Objective | AI Persona | AI Dialogue Style | Key Grammar/Patterns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lv 1** | **Newborn** | ~300 | **Word Recognition**<br>"This is an apple." | Parent | Asks single-word questions and expands the user's one-word answers into full sentences. "Apple." â†’ "Yes, this is an apple." | Nouns, `be`-verbs (present) |
| **Lv 2** | **Toddler** | ~600 | **Self-centered Sentences**<br>"I like apples." | Teacher | Asks simple `Subject + Verb` questions. "Do you like apples?" | Action verbs, pronouns |
| **Lv 3** | **Lower Elementary** | 1,000 | **Expressing Reasons**<br>"I like apples because they are sweet." | Close Friend | Introduces "Why?" to prompt simple reasoning. "Why do you like it?" | `because`, adjectives |
| **Lv 4** | **Upper Elementary** | 1,500 | **Expanding Thought**<br>"If it rains, I will stay home." | Older Sibling | Introduces hypotheticals (`If`) and comparisons (`more`, `-er`). "What if it rains?" | `if`, comparatives |
| **Lv 5** | **Middle Schooler** | 3,000 | **Connecting Sentences**<br>"I know the boy who is wearing a red shirt." | Classmate | Prompts descriptive sentences using relative pronouns (`who`, `which`, `that`). | Relative pronouns |
| **Lv 6** | **High Schooler** | 8,000 | **Logical Arguments**<br>"Although it's expensive, it's worth it." | Debate Partner | Presents topics requiring logical counters using conjunctions (`Although`, `but`, `however`). | Concessive conjunctions |
| **Lv 7** | **University Student** | 12,000 | **Abstract Opinions**<br>"In my opinion, that policy will be ineffective." | Seminar Member | Asks for opinions on abstract topics (society, culture) with supporting reasons. | Advanced modals, infinitives |
| **Lv 8** | **Grad Student** | 15,000 | **Past Hypotheticals**<br>"If I had studied more, I would have passed." | Professor | Prompts analysis of counter-factual past events using the past perfect subjunctive. | Subjunctive mood |
| **Lv 9** | **Professional** | 18,000+ | **Purpose-Driven Speech**<br>"Could you please send me the documents?" | Business Partner | Simulates work situations (meetings, negotiations) requiring formal and polite expressions. | Formal speech, indirect questions |
| **Lv 10** | **Expert** | 20,000+ | **Nuanced Expression**<br>"That is, so to speak, a double-edged sword." | Native Peer | Uses idioms, proverbs, and humor to test cultural and contextual understanding. | Idiomatic expressions |

## 3. Learning & Retention Mechanism

### A. Pattern-Focused, Conversation-Based Learning

Our methodology follows a 3-step cycle:
1.  **Word Recognition:** Introduce new, high-frequency vocabulary.
2.  **Pattern Acquisition:** Learn sentence structures to utilize the new words.
3.  **AI Conversation:** Apply patterns in a dynamic, simulated conversation.

AI-driven role-playing scenarios repeatedly expose the learner to core patterns until they become second nature.

### B. Dual-Lock Level-Up System (Forgetting Curve Integration)

To ensure true mastery, leveling up requires satisfying two conditions:

1.  **Quantitative Goal (Completion):** Clear all 10 "stages" within a level, earning Experience Points (EXP).
2.  **Qualitative Goal (Mastery):** Pass a "Unlock Test" for all expressions that were previously flagged by the forgetting curve algorithm.

The forgetting curve engine schedules reviews at optimized intervals (Day+1, Day+3, Day+7, Day+30). An expression is only considered "mastered" after passing the Day+30 review.

### C. Gamification & Motivation

*   **EXP System:**
    *   Stage Clear: +10 EXP
    *   Review Success: +5 EXP
    *   Daily Streak Bonus: +3 EXP
*   **Streak Rewards:**
    *   **3-Day Streak:** +5 EXP Bonus
    *   **7-Day Streak:** Unlock a special idiomatic expression (e.g., "It's a piece of cake").

## 4. Intelligent Feedback System

*   **Level-Based Vocabulary Filtering:** The AI provides feedback that is appropriate for the user's current level.
    > *"â€˜Consequenceâ€™ is a great word, but at your level, it's more natural to say â€˜resultâ€™."*
*   **Nuance Explanations:** On-demand, concise Korean explanations of subtle differences between similar expressions.
    > **AI:** *You could say, "You **have to** see a doctor."*
    > **Explanation:** *In Korean: â€˜mustâ€™ implies strong personal obligation, while â€˜have toâ€™ refers to an obligation from external rules or circumstances.*
*   **Pronunciation Analysis:** Provides a quantitative accuracy score (%) and phonetic feedback on mispronounced sounds.
    > *"You said [gud], but the correct sound is [gÊŠd]."*
*   **Paraphrasing:** The AI introduces varied expressions to move beyond repetitive patterns.
    > **Lv 7:** *Instead of "If I were you," try "In your shoes..."*
