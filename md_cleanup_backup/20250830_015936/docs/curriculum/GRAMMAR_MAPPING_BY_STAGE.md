# DaSi English Learning Platform - Grammar Mapping by Stage

### Subsequent Phases (Stages 43-66)
[Additional phases would continue following the same pattern, building systematically on previous knowledge]

## Grammar Prohibition Rules

### Level Boundaries
- **Level 1 (Stages 1-16)**: No progressive tenses, no modal verbs, no complex sentences
- **Level 2 (Stages 17-36)**: No perfect tenses, no passive voice, no conditionals
- **Level 3 (Stages 37-66)**: No advanced conditionals, no subjunctive mood
- **Levels 4-10**: Progressive complexity with careful boundary maintenance

### Sequential Learning Violations (FORBIDDEN)
- Using present perfect in Level 1 or 2
- Using passive voice before Stage 41
- Using conditionals before appropriate level introduction
- Using gerunds/infinitives before proper introduction
- Using relative clauses before systematic introduction

## Implementation Notes
1. Each stage builds ONLY on previously learned grammar
2. New grammar concepts are introduced incrementally
3. Form distribution maintained: 60% affirmative, 20% negative, 20% questions
4. Vocabulary complexity increases gradually
5. Sentence length progression: simple → compound → complex
